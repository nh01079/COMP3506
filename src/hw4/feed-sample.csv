8,hob,04/01/2019 10:00:00,100,Puns are my priority - I have a heap of them. I am quick to hash out new puns by merging bits of words together and can even do 2-4 at a time. I kinda feel like I have a big-O(bligation) to consistently make puns - it is a good thing I am always capable of splaying out a stack of them. I'm a big fan of the depth of some graph puns but I tend to direct myself so I only touch the edge of the breadth of these puns - I don't like being too greedy. I do trie very hard to leaf some of my tree puns alone but I am stuck in a bit of a root-ine.
9,emily,04/01/2019 10:01:00,99,oh please no
